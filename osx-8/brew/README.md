# Mac OS X 10.8 Snow Leopard and HomeBrew

This is a set of snippets used to capture installation of packages uses HomeBrew as of July, 2014.  I specify the date because HomeBrew scripts and packages may change at any moment as they are fetched from the Internet.

## Unix Shell and Unix Tools

I wanted to fetch a pure POSIX shell to test out portable scripts:

```bash
brew install dash

DASH(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  DASH(1)

NAME
     dash -- command interpreter (shell)

SYNOPSIS
     dash [-aCefnuvxIimqVEb] [+aCefnuvxIimqVEb] [-o option_name]
          [+o option_name] [command_file [argument ...]]
     dash -c [-aCefnuvxIimqVEb] [+aCefnuvxIimqVEb] [-o option_name]

          [+o option_name] [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
     dash is the standard command interpreter for the system.  The current
     version of dash is in the process of being changed to conform with the
     POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the shell.  This version has
     many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn
     shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features des-

```

Then for Korn shell:

```bash
brew install ksh

And of course, Bourne Again Shell 4.x, as Mac OS X comes with icky old version of Bash 3.x:


```bash
brew install bash

A patch is required to get Bash 4.3 to work on Mac OS X.  I will dig into this later.
